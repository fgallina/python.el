;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode for editing Python files with some fontification and
;; indentation bits extracted from original Dave Love's python.el
;; found in GNU/Emacs.

;; While it probably has less features than Dave Love's python.el and
;; PSF's python-mode.el it provides the main stuff you'll need while
;; keeping it simple :)

;; Implements Syntax highlighting, Indentation, Movement, Shell
;; interaction, Shell completion, Pdb tracking, Symbol completion,
;; Eldoc.

;; Syntax highlighting: Fontification of code is provided and supports
;; python's triple quoted strings properly.

;; Indentation: Automatic indentation with indentation cycling is
;; provided, it allows you to navigate different available levels of
;; indentation by hitting <tab> several times.

;; Movement: `beginning-of-defun' and `end-of-defun' functions are
;; properly implemented.  A `beginning-of-innermost-defun' is defined
;; to navigate nested defuns.

;; Shell interaction: is provided and allows you easily execute any
;; block of code of your current buffer in an inferior Python process.

;; Shell completion: hitting tab will try to complete the current
;; word.  Shell completion is implemented in a manner that if you
;; change the `python-shell-interpreter' to any other (for example
;; IPython) it should be easy to integrate another way to calculate
;; completions.  You just need to specify your custom
;; `python-shell-completion-setup-code' and
;; `python-shell-completion-strings-code'

;; Pdb tracking: when you execute a block of code that contains some
;; call to pdb (or ipdb) it will prompt the block of code and will
;; follow the execution of pdb marking the current line with an arrow.

;; Symbol completion: you can complete the symbol at point.  It uses
;; the shell completion in background so you should run
;; `python-shell-send-buffer' from time to time to get better results.

;; FFAP: You can find the filename for a given module when using ffap
;; out of the box.  This feature needs an inferior python shell
;; running.

;; Code check: Check the current file for errors using
;; `python-check-command'

;; Eldoc: returns documentation for object at point by using the
;; inferior python subprocess to inspect its documentation.  As you
;; might guessed you should run `python-shell-send-buffer' from time
;; to time to get better results too.

;; If you used python-mode.el you probably will miss auto-indentation
;; when inserting newlines.  To achieve the same behavior you have
;; two options:

;; 1) Use GNU/Emacs' standard binding for `newline-and-indent': C-j.

;; 2) Add the following hook in your .emacs:

;; (add-hook 'python-mode-hook
;;   #'(lambda ()
;;       (define-key python-mode-map "\C-m" 'newline-and-indent)))

;; I'd recommend the first one since you'll get the same behavior for
;; all modes out-of-the-box.

;;; Installation:

;; Add this to your .emacs:

;; (add-to-list 'load-path "/folder/containing/file")
;; (require 'python)

;;; TODO:

;; Ordered by priority:

;; Better decorator support for beginning of defun

;; Review code and cleanup

;; (Perhaps) some skeletons (I never use them because of yasnippet)

;;; Code:

(require 'comint)
(require 'ansi-color)
(require 'outline)

(eval-when-compile
  (require 'cl))

(autoload 'comint-mode "comint")

;;;###autoload
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist (cons (purecopy "\\.py\\'")  'python-mode))
